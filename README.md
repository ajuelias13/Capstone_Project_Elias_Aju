# Income Level Prediction 

**Project Overview**

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a personâ€™s income exceeds $50K per year based on census data. By leveraging various features from the census dataset, I will explore the data, engineer relevant features, build and evaluate a predictive model, and provide insights from the data. This project will help in understanding the factors that influence income levels and can assist in policy-making, socio-economic studies, and other related fields. 

**Dataset Overview**

The dataset used for this project consists of 48,842 entries, each representing an individual's census data. It contains the following 15 features:

1.	Age: The age of the individual.
2.	Workclass: The employment status of the individual (e.g., Private, Self-emp-not-inc, State-gov).
3.	Fnlwgt: The final weight, which represents the number of people the census believes the entry represents.
4.	Education: The highest level of education attained by the individual.
5.	Education-num: The number of years of education completed.
6.	Marital-status: The marital status of the individual (e.g., Never-married, Married-civ spouse).
7.	Occupation: The occupation of the individual (e.g., Adm-clerical, Exec-managerial).
8.	Relationship: The individual's relationship status within a family (e.g., Not-in-family, Husband).
9.	Race: The race of the individual (e.g., White, Black).
10.	Sex: The gender of the individual. 
11.	Capital-gain: Capital gains recorded for the individual.
12.	Capital-loss: Capital losses recorded for the individual. 
13.	Hours-per-week: The number of hours worked per week. 
14.	Native-country: The native country of the individual.
15.	Income: The target variable indicating whether the individual's income is greater than or less than or equal to $50K per year  (<=50K, >50K)

These features provide a comprehensive overview of the socio-economic status and work related characteristics of the individuals, which can be used to predict their income levels. By training a machine learning model on this dataset, I aim to accurately classify whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year, thereby gaining insights into the determinants of income levels.
